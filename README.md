## A simple CLI [Rock-Paper-Scissors] game  

**[Rock-Paper-Scissors]**
---
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple two-player game where, at a signal, players make figures with their hands, representing a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors. The winner is determined according to a set of rules. You can find the official rules under the *resources*.

---
In this simple version, one player will be controlled by the computer and the other player controlled by you - the users (i.e CPU vs Player).

The inbuilt Python module **random** and it's method **choice** is used to get a random value from the computer.

Check both moves and declare the winner.
